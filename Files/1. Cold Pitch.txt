In North America, everything from a coffee to a car or a condo, is procured with credit. This dependence on credit is embedded into the society so much so that parents have to have 'the talk' with teenagers on the importance of building a credit history. But, the current system is broken. There are 2 bureaus that monitor Canadian's credit score and history. Not only are they slow, and isolated from each other, but they are also isolated from their international subsidiaries. Blockchain can solve this discrepancy by standardising and interconnecting the global credit bureaus into a Better Credit Bureau. 

The credit card suppliers Amex, Visa and Mastercard report to BCB, which is a private permissioned blockchain. BCBs of different countries talk to each other using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and monitor if a credit profile in one country matches a credit profile in another country. As a result the credit history of a person migrates and BCB is able to keep a better check on fraudulent activity.
